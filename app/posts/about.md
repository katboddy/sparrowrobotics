## This is me

I used to tell myself stories as a kid.
<br>
<br>
I am old enough to have had a childhood without a phone 
or cable TV - being born in Eastern Europe helped - so I had those long periods
of <i>silence</i> when I would just daydream myself some faraway
rich place with damn nice clothes.
<br>
I remember a certain precision to those stories. I knew I wanted to be rich,
but I also knew <i>exactly how much money</i> I needed to buy a house, 
a car (red corvette), an exact number of dresses / shoes / handbags, etc.
<br>
<br>
Becoming a programmer did not make me rich or cure me of OCD.
I had a corvette (blue) briefly, but I never passed a driving test.
I also stopped telling myself stories and writing.
<br>
<br>
Couple years ago I realized that programming is not all in terms
of creativity, so I started making amigurumis. But the resulting
plushies couldn't do things <i>on their own</i>.
<br>
<br>
Could I learn enough about Artificial Intelligence to make something that
feels both creative but can also do, let's say accounting for me?
This journal will try to answer this question.
