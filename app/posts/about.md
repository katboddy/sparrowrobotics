## This is me

I used to tell myself stories as a kid.
<br>
<br>
I am old enough to have had a childhood without a phone 
or cable TV - being born in Eastern Europe helped - so I had those long periods
of <i>silence</i> when I would just daydream myself some faraway
rich place with damn nice clothes.
<br>
I remember a certain precision to those stories. I knew I wanted to be rich,
but I also knew <i>exactly how much money</i> I needed to buy a house, 
a car (red corvette), an exact number of dresses / shoes / handbags, etc.
<br>
<br>
Becoming a programmer did not make me rich or cure me of OCD.
I had a corvette (blue) briefly, but I never passed a driving test.
I also stopped telling myself stories and writing.
<br>
<br>
Couple years ago I realized that programming is not all in terms
of creativity, so I started crocheting amigurumis and knitting sweaters.
<br>
<br>
Now, as a tech lead, I find myself doing less and less programming. 
I attend too many meetings. I review too many RFCs. And what I miss 
the most is the learning. The discovery. Writing things down. 
<i>Telling myself stories.</i> Not always about programming. 
Not even always about science stuff. What I learned could be intangible 
and this blog is an attempt to capture it.
