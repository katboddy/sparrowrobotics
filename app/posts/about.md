## This is me

I used to tell myself stories as a kid.
<br>
<br>
I am old enough to have had childhood without phone 
or cable TV - being born in Eastern Europe helped - so I had those long periods
of <i>silence</i> when I would just daydream myself some faraway
rich place with damn nice clothes.
<br>
I remember certain precision to those stories. I knew I wanted to be rich,
but I also knew <i>exactly how much money</i> I needed to buy house, 
a car (red corvette), x amount of dresses / shoes / handbags, etc.
<br>
<br>
Becoming a programmer did not make me rich or cure me of OCD.
I had a corvette (blue) briefly, but I never passed a driving test.
I also stopped telling myself stories and writing.
<br>
<br>
Couple years ago I have realized that programming is not all in terms
of creativity, so I started making amigurumis. But they didn't <i>move</i>.
This journal will document my learning path to build something that moves.
