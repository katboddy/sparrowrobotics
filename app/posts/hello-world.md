## Hello, World!

Where should I start?

- I can code 
- I love building things
- I love breaking things even more
- I used to write for fun, but it was so long ago I forgot how
- I was exceptional at math, but recently I had to look up matrix multiplication and derivatives of trigonometric functions

I want to build something. I want to write about it. So where do I start? Where does every programmer start?
